## Module 1: Understanding Savings Circles (20 min)

### 1.1 What is Ajo/Esusu?

Ajo (Yoruba) or Esusu is a traditional African group savings system where members:
- Contribute a fixed amount regularly
- Take turns receiving the pooled amount
- Build financial discipline together
- Support each other's financial goals

**HustleX digitizes this traditional practice**, making it safer, more convenient, and trackable.

### 1.2 How It Works (Example)

**10 members, ₦10,000 weekly contributions:**

| Week | Contributions | Pool | Recipient |
|------|--------------|------|-----------|
| 1 | 10 × ₦10,000 | ₦100,000 | Member 1 |
| 2 | 10 × ₦10,000 | ₦100,000 | Member 2 |
| 3 | 10 × ₦10,000 | ₦100,000 | Member 3 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 10 | 10 × ₦10,000 | ₦100,000 | Member 10 |

**Total contributed by each member:** ₦100,000
**Total received by each member:** ₦100,000

### 1.3 Types of Savings Circles

**Type 1: Rotational (Traditional Ajo)**

```
How it works:
- Fixed contribution amount
- Members have assigned positions
- Each period, one member receives the full pool
- Continues until everyone has received
```

**Best for:**
- Planned expenses (rent, school fees, equipment)
- Need lump sum at specific time
- Disciplined savers

**Type 2: Fixed Target**

```
How it works:
- Members save toward individual goals
- No rotation - everyone saves for themselves
- Withdraw when you reach your target
- Group provides accountability
```

**Best for:**
- Emergency fund building
- General savings habit
- Flexible withdrawal needs

### 1.4 Benefits of Group Savings

| Benefit | How HustleX Helps |
|---------|------------------|
| **Discipline** | Automatic reminders and tracking |
| **Security** | Funds held in escrow, not with individuals |
| **Transparency** | See all contributions in real-time |
| **Accountability** | Group visibility encourages commitment |
| **Credit Building** | Regular contributions boost credit score |

## Module 2: Joining a Savings Circle (20 min)

### 2.1 Finding a Circle

**Option 1: Browse Public Circles**
1. Tap "Savings" tab
2. Browse available circles
3. Use filters:
   - Contribution amount
   - Frequency (weekly/monthly)
   - Number of members
   - Circle type

**Option 2: Join via Invite Code**
1. Get invite code from circle admin
2. Tap "Savings" → "Join Circle"
3. Enter invite code
4. Review and confirm

### 2.2 What to Check Before Joining

**Circle Details Checklist:**

- [ ] Frequency matches your income
- [ ] Number of members (more members = longer cycle)
- [ ] Start date works for you
- [ ] Know the circle admin
- [ ] Understand the rules

### 2.3 Understanding Your Position

In rotational circles, your position determines when you receive:

**Position 1:** First to receive (immediately, but must continue paying)
**Position 5 (of 10):** Middle - balanced wait time
**Position 10:** Last to receive (but guaranteed everyone else paid)

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Early position: Get funds when you need them urgently
- Later position: More certainty that others will pay
- Middle position: Balanced approach

### 2.4 Exercise: Find a Circle

1. Open the Savings tab
2. Browse available circles
3. Find one matching these criteria:
   - ₦5,000 - ₦10,000 weekly contribution
   - 5-10 members
   - Starting within 2 weeks
4. Review all details
5. (Optional) Join if it fits your needs

## Module 4: Receiving Payouts (15 min)

### 4.1 Rotational Payout Process

When it's your turn:

```
Day before payout:
→ Notification: "Tomorrow is your payout day!"

Payout day:
→ All contributions collected
→ Funds transferred to your wallet
→ Notification: "You received ₦100,000!"
```

### 4.2 Using Your Payout

Once received, you can:
- **Leave in wallet** - Use for future expenses
- **Transfer** - Send to bank or other users
- **Invest** - Use for business/assets
- **Save more** - Join another circle!

### 4.3 After Your Payout

**Important:** Continue contributing until the cycle ends!

```
Example (Position 3 of 10):
- Week 3: You receive ₦100,000
- Weeks 4-10: You still contribute ₦10,000/week
- Total remaining: 7 weeks × ₦10,000 = ₦70,000
```

This ensures members after you also receive their payouts.

### 4.4 Fixed Target Withdrawals

For fixed target circles:
1. Check your saved amount
2. Tap "Request Withdrawal"
3. Confirm amount
4. Enter PIN
5. Funds transferred to wallet
