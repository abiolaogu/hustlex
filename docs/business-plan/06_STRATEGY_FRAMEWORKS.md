## 6.2 Porter's Five Forces

Analysis of industry competitive dynamics.

### Force 1: Competitive Rivalry

**Intensity: HIGH**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Number of competitors | High (200+ fintechs) |
| Industry growth | High (20%+ CAGR) - mitigates rivalry |
| Product differentiation | Low in payments, High in integrated solutions |
| Switching costs | Low for users |
| Exit barriers | Medium (sunk costs, reputation) |

**Implication:** Intense competition in payments; differentiate through integration.

### Force 2: Threat of New Entrants

**Intensity: MEDIUM**

| Barrier | Strength |
|---------|----------|
| Capital requirements | Medium (seed stage viable) |
| Regulatory requirements | High (licenses required) |
| Technology | Low (APIs available) |
| Brand/trust | High (takes time to build) |
| Network effects | Medium (once established) |
| Distribution | Medium (agents, partnerships) |

**Implication:** Barriers are surmountable but significant; first-mover advantage important.

### Force 3: Threat of Substitutes

**Intensity: HIGH**

| Substitute | Threat Level |
|------------|--------------|
| Cash | High (still 85% of transactions) |
| Traditional banking | Medium (poor UX, exclusionary) |
| Informal Ajo (paper-based) | High (current behavior) |
| Loan sharks | Medium (expensive but available) |
| Family/friend loans | High (free, trusted) |

**Implication:** Must be significantly better than substitutes to drive adoption.

### Force 4: Bargaining Power of Buyers

**Intensity: MEDIUM-HIGH**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Number of buyers | Very high (millions) |
| Switching costs | Low |
| Price sensitivity | High |
| Information availability | High (app stores, reviews) |
| Product importance | High (financial services) |

**Implication:** Must deliver clear value; competitive pricing essential.

### Force 5: Bargaining Power of Suppliers

**Intensity: LOW-MEDIUM**

| Supplier | Power Level | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Payment processors (Paystack) | Medium | Few alternatives, but competitive market |
| SMS providers (Termii) | Low | Many alternatives |
| Cloud providers (AWS) | Low | Many alternatives |
| Banking partners | Medium | Limited licensed partners |
| Talent | Medium-High | Competition for developers |

**Implication:** Diversify suppliers; invest in talent retention.

### Five Forces Summary

       LOW-MEDIUM ────▶ │   COMPETITIVE       │ ◀──── MEDIUM-HIGH
                        │    RIVALRY          │
                        │      HIGH           │
                        └─────────────────────┘
                                   ▲
                                   │
                                   │
                         THREAT OF SUBSTITUTES
                                 HIGH
```

**Strategic Response:**
1. Build differentiation through integration (reduce rivalry)
2. Create switching costs via credit history, savings (reduce buyer power)
3. Lock in partnerships early (reduce supplier power)
4. Move fast to build network effects (raise entry barriers)
5. Significantly outperform substitutes (reduce substitute threat)
